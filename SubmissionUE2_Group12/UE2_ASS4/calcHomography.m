% (b) Estimate the homography between these points using cp2tform. Choose 'projective'

% pairs are not chosen properly (e.g. three of them lie on the same line). The easiest
% way to handle this is to use a try-catch-block when calling cp2tform.
% (c) Transform all other points of putative matches in the first image using tformfwd.
